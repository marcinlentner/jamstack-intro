        The problem in the past has been the man turning us against one another.
        We have been unable to see the truth, because we’ve been fighting for
        ten square feet of ground. Our turf, our little piece of turf. That’s
        crap brothers. The turf is ours by right, because it’s our turn. All we
        have to do is keep up the general truce. We take over one borough at a
        time. Secure our territory, secure our turf, because it’s all our turf!
